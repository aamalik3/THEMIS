**üöÄ About**

THEMIS (Time, Heterogeneity, and Energy Minded Scheduling) is a next-generation scheduling framework that ensures fair, energy-aware, and realistic multi-tenant use of cloud FPGAs.
Unlike prior works, THEMIS accounts for execution time, heterogeneous hardware regions, and energy trade-offs, offering significantly improved fairness and resource utilization.
Tested on a real Xilinx ZedBoard FPGA, THEMIS improves fairness by 24.2%‚Äì98.4% and enables an adjustable balance between energy efficiency and fairness ‚Äî setting a new standard for secure and sustainable FPGA cloud services.

**‚ú® Features**
Time-Aware Scheduling:
Incorporates execution time estimates to promote fairness among tenants.

**Heterogeneity-Aware Mapping:**
Models and leverages the variations in hardware resources across FPGA regions.

**Energy-Aware Optimization:**
Allows tuning between fairness and energy efficiency based on system goals.

**Fair Multi-Tenant Resource Management:**
Ensures equitable sharing of FPGA resources even under adversarial or greedy workloads.

**Tested on Real Hardware:**
Evaluated on Xilinx ZedBoard, demonstrating 24.2%‚Äì98.4% fairness improvement over existing baselines.

**Lightweight and Practical:**
Designed for easy integration into real-world cloud FPGA deployments.
